### Getting Started

To get the project up and running locally, you'll need to set up both the front-end and back-end.

**Prerequisites:**

  * Node.js and npm (or yarn)

**Installation & Setup:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Set up the Back-End:**
      * Navigate to the `backend` directory.
      * Install dependencies: `npm install`
      * Start the server: `npm start`
3.  **Set up the Front-End:**
      * Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
      * Install dependencies: `npm install`
      * Start the development server: `npm run dev`

The application should now be running, with the front-end accessible in your browser (typically at `http://localhost:5173`) and the back-end API running on its configured port.
